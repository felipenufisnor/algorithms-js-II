Algorithms with JavaScript II: diving deeper into sort and search algorithms

In this project I learned more examples of sort and search algorithms;
I understood the concepts and paradigms behind the studied algorithms;
I developed the practice of translating the algorithm's logic into code;
I analyzed the code of an algorithm to understand its complexity;
I understood how algorithms solve computing problems.
